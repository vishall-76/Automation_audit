## 🎨 Visual System

*   **Background:** Deep Charcoal (`#0e0f12`) to Near-Black (`#111318`).
*   **Typography:** Inter or Geist (sans-serif), tracking tight, high readability.
*   **Accents:** Muted Steel Blue (`#64748b`), Off-White (`#f8fafc`).
*   **Imagery:** Functional abstract diagrams, node graphs, clean UI fragments. No robots.

## 🧱 Section 1: Hero
**Goal:** Instant clarity. Outcome over technology.

*   **Visual:** A split layout or centered max-width. To the right/center: A high-fidelity, abstract visualization of a "messy" workflow turning into a straight, clean line (The "Trident" efficiency).
*   **Headline:** Stop Burn Rate. Start Autonomy.
*   **Subheadline:** Transform manual operations into deterministic agentic workflows. Reduce CAC and operational drag without hiring more headcount.
*   **Primary CTA:** [ Start Free Workflow Audit ] (Button: Muted White, Black Text)
*   **Secondary CTA:** [ See the Logic ] (Button: Transparent, Thin Border)

## 🧱 Section 2: The Reality Check (Problem)
**Goal:** Empathy through brutal honesty.
**Layout:** Three strict columns or a horizontal scrolling "ticker" of data points.

*   **Copy:**
    *   **Headline:** The "AI Revolution" left your Ops team behind.
    *   **Point 1 (CAC):** **Acquisition costs doubled.** Ad spend is burning faster than revenue can grow.
    *   **Point 2 (Tools):** **Tool sprawl is the new debt.** Your team is glued to Zapier, not strategy.
    *   **Point 3 (Outcome):** **AI without outcomes.** You have 10 "AI tools" but 0 autonomous processes.

## 🧱 Section 3: The New Way (The Shift)
**Goal:** Introduce the tailored solution without buzzwords.
**Layout:** Left-aligned text, right-aligned interactive graph (fades in nodes as you scroll).

*   **Headline:** Deterministic Automation.
*   **Body:** Stop relying on probabilistic "chatbots". We build specific, agentic workflows that execute defined tasks with 100% auditability.
*   **Key Concept:** **Demo-Led Growth**. Your product should sell itself. Our agents handle the qualification, routing, and initial setup, so your humans only talk to closers.

## 🧱 Section 4: How It Works
**Goal:** Simply the complex.
**Layout:** 3-Step Vertical Timeline. Connected by a subtle, pulsing line.

1.  **Step 1: The Audit**
    *   **Visual:** Scanning animation over a calendar/process map.
    *   **Copy:** **We map your manual friction.** We identify exactly where your team loses hours to copy-pasting and context switching.
2.  **Step 2: The Architecture**
    *   **Visual:** A clean "Blueprint" grid appearing.
    *   **Copy:** **We design the agentic layer.** Eliminating waste points and replacing them with decision-capable nodes.
3.  **Step 3: The Deployment**
    *   **Visual:** A green "Active" status light pulsing.
    *   **Copy:** **Live Automation.** Systems run in the background. You get a weekly report on hours saved ($).

## 🧱 Section 5: Proof & Benchmarks
**Goal:** Hard data.
**Layout:** Large, borderless metric cards. Big numbers.

*   **Metric 1:** **40%** Reduction in CAC within 90 days.
*   **Metric 2:** **120+** Hours saved per RevOps manager/month.
*   **Metric 3:** **3x** Increase in qualified demo bookings.

## 🧱 Section 6: Capabilities (Product)
**Goal:** Show, don't tell.
**Layout:** Bento Grid (Grid of cards).

*   **Card 1 (Large):** **The Audit Engine.** (Visual: A heatmap of process inefficiencies).
*   **Card 2 (Small):** **Guardrails, not Hallucinations.** (Visual: A code-diff style checkmark).
*   **Card 3 (Medium):** **Interactive Demos.** (Visual: cursor moving through a flow).
*   **Card 4 (Medium):** **Human-in-the-loop Handoff.** (Visual: seamless transfer notification).

## 🧱 Section 7: Objection Handling (FAQ)
**Goal:** Address skepticism derived from "hype".
**Layout:** Accordion (Clean lines, minimal motion).

*   **Q: "Is this just another wrapper?"**
    *   A: No. We build custom logic layers on top of enterprise-grade LLMs, constrained by your specific business rules. It’s engineering, not prompting.
*   **Q: "What if the AI breaks?"**
    *   A: We use deterministic fallbacks. If confidence drops below 99%, the agent instantly routes to a human with full context.
*   **Q: "How long is migration?"**
    *   A: We don't migrate; we integrate. Our layer sits on top of your existing CRM and marketing stack. Day 1 utility.

## 🧱 Section 8: Final CTA
**Goal:** Low risk entry.
**Layout:** Minimalist centered block.

*   **Headline:** Stop optimizing manual misery.
*   **Subhead:** Get a clear view of where you're losing money.
*   **Button:** [ Run My Workflow Audit ] (Arrow icon)
*   **Subtext:** Free analysis. No commitment. Delivered in 24 hours.
